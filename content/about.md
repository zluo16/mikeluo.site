    I graduated from music school two years ago and started learning how to code while interning at a music studio. My dad found a piece of software that allowed me to write scripts to automate certain tasks in Pro Tools with Python. I initially started learning how to program specifically to use this piece of software, but I eventually got immersed and quickly developed a big interest in programming. At that point, the wheels were set in motion, and not before long, I started playing around with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

    I attended Flatiron School's Software Engineering Immersive last year, where I picked up React and Ruby on Rails, then took some time to learn Node and contribute to opensource projects. Recently I completed an internship at a meal-kit company called Plated where I contributed to a Rails project using AWS S3, Elastic Trasncoder, and CloudFront to handle media distribution.

    I've always had a passion for learning. People have often asked me what I would do with my life if money wasn't an issue, and I'm convinced if that were the case I would be compelled to be a lifelong academic. There's something about diving deeply into new, abstract concepts and finding out where the dots connect that really draws me in. And initially, this is what drew me to music composition. I still absolutely have a passion for music, but one can easily see how I might be drawn to software engineering as well. I've always believed that these two feilds were much more similar than they may seem at surface level and I intend to continually prove it!
