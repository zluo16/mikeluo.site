The webpage is designed using React, custom CSS & Semantic UI.
I used JavaScript and a Jeopardy API  to handle game logic & UI and
managed state with Redux. The backend was built using Ruby on Rails and I also incorporated a user auth functionality using JSON web tokens and Railsâ€™ standard Redis store.
