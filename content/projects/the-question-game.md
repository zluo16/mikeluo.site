This is a multiple choice word game where you answer as many questions as you can within a limited amount of time. You get a certain amount of points for every correct answer you select. At the end, your points are tallied and given to you. Seconds are added to the timer for each correct answer, Points are lost for every wrong answer.

the UI is built using React and MaterialUI. Game logic is handled with JavaScript and React. There's a Jeopardy API called jservice.io That I use to find questions and answers.
